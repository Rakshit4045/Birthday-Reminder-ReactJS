Hey There...! This my first reactjs project. I just completed a reactjs tutorial on youtube on FreeCodeCamp channel(John Smilga's tutorial). It included lot of tasks and one of them was creating a basic Birthday Reminder app. I tried to improve the project by providing funtionalities such as adding peoples and their birthday. You can find the working app here (https://admiring-mcclintock-a141fa.netlify.app/). Thankyou.....!
